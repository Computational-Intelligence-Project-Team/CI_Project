# CI_Project

This projects aims to solve the maximum clique problem in graph theory using evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Ant-Colony Optimization, and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization. The project further performs analysis and comparison of all these algorithms and reports individual accuracies after testing with multiple initial values.
